SpaceAce is a side-scrolling space shooter game that I built in Java (around 2012).
I was learning about graphics (pixels, movement of objects, screen dimensions, etc.), time/clock in a game, and collision detection.
The game has asteroids and enemy ships that you can shoot (they explode on impact) or collide with (if you don't shoot or dodge them!)
There are  stars flying by in the foreground and a galaxy image in the background.
Feel free to take this game and run with it if you want.
I might convert it to JavaScript at some point...let me know if you have any questions.
